## About

### Who is involved in making this happen? 

- A wide variety of people, with a wide range of Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Interests. 
- We hope multiple orgs are part of this creation, as multiple orgs have something like this on their backlogs and roadmaps, and the entire metaverse benefits when we increase the number of creators. 

## :bulb: Why are we here? 

>"I wanted to take all of my bookmarks that helped me become a webxr dev, and create a wiki that would help others" - Liam

We want to organically create value by helping others become Metaverse creators and contributors. We want to find creative ways to sustain ourselves. We want to create incentive structures that align with peoples values. 

People need something that keeps them focused, and moving forward on their mission to get involved with the Metaverse. It can be easy to run into a roadblock, and get deflated or distracted. We want to make achieving the goal of becoming or improving as a Metaverse creator more attainable. We want to create incentive structures that align with peoples values. 

Furthermore, we should strive to deliver this message with minimal fluff or bullshit. The goal should be to enable folks to discover solutions and make effective choices, using _inclusive language_. 

Eventually we will have more options for metaverse contributors. Beyond developers, there will be metaverse designers, metaverse modelers, and even metaverse entertainers. Shops, services, SaaS.
